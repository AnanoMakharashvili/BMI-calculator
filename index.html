      <p class="paragraph-style">
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
        Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
        health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a
        nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample
        fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
        activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

      <h1 class="limit-style">Limitations of BMI</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-style">
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
        suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their
        BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
        beneficial to use.

      </div>
      <p class="paragraph-style">
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with
        age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
        evaluating their BMI.

        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI
        to underestimate body fat content.

        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it
        doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.
